## Problem Statement
In the present day, the power of organizing hackathons rely only with central authorities. Thus, people with more reach and influence lead the decision-making process. This leads to a lack of clarity in how funds are managed, potentially leading to less-than-ideal event experiences and a community that feels excluded.

## Solution
With HackDAO, we aim to involve the general public by building a community and enabling them to participate in the decision making process, thus making their voices heard. All these below mentioned processes happens prior to the hackathon, We have divided it into 2 phases - Registration & Voting phase. 

The following occur during the 2 stages:

### Engagement of Participants:
Involve participants of the Hackathon by enabling them to invest cryptocurrency and participate in decision-making, including choosing the venue, selecting food options, and suggesting experiences like bean bags, gaming areas, and energy drinks during the event.

### Sponsor fund management & Distribution
Sponsors are responsible for the growth of the hackathon and enhancing the experience. Sponsors submit a proposal with a criteria and if that is satisfied, the smart contract releases the sponsor funds to the organizer and protocol tokens(xHACKS) to the sponsor. This motivates hackers to register and stake thereby improving the overall quality of the hackathon.

### Incentivization based on participation:
We Gamify the pre-hackathon preparation process by rewarding participants with tokens for their engagement and contributions.
Creates an interactive and engaging experience by introducing a reputation score which the hacker can build by participating, winning hacks, and contributing to the quality of hacks by voting.

### Fairness and Accountability:
Ensures fairness and accountability in the event organization process by utilizing blockchain technology to record and verify all transactions and decisions.
Eliminates the risk of bias or manipulation, enhancing the integrity and credibility of the event.
